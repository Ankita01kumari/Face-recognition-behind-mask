# Face-recognition-behind-mask
The COVID-19 virus can be spread through contact and contaminated surfaces, therefore, the classical biometric systems based on passwords or ﬁfingerprint are not anymore safe. Face recognition is safer without any need to touch any device. Recent studies on corona virus have proven that wearing a face mask by a healthy and infected population reduces considerably the transmission of this virus. However, wearing the mask face causes the following problems 
1)fraudsters and thieves take advantage of the mask, stealing and committing crimes without being identityﬁed. 
2)community access control and face authentication have become very difficult tasks when a grand part of the face is hidden by a mask.
3) existing face recognition methods are not efﬁcient when wearing a mask which cannot provide the whole face image for description.
4) exposing the nose region is very important in the task of face recognition since it is used for face normalization , pose correction  and face matching
Due to these problems, face masks have signiﬁcantly challenged existing face recognition methods
